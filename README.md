Lumail
======

lumail is a modal console-based email client, which features extensive scripting
support, via an embedded Lua intepretter.

You'll find [a quick introduction to using lumail](http://lumail.org/getting-started/) on
the [lumail website](http://lumail.org), along with [screenshots](http://lumail.org/screenshots/).

In brief `lumail` is a modal application, so you're *always* in one of three states:

* Interacting with lists of mailboxes.
* This is the mode you'll start in.
* Default keybindings include:
   * Press `a` to view all mailboxes.
   * Press `n` to view mailboxes containing new mail only.
   * Move around via `j`/`k`/`/`.
   * You may open the single selected folder by pressing `RETURN`.
   * Or you may toggle the selected state by pressing `SPACE` and jumping into index mode with `I` when you've selected all the folders you care about.
* Interacting with lists of messages.  These messages may come from more than one folder.
* Default keybindings include:
   * Press `a` to view all messages.
   * Press `n` to view new messages only.
   * Move around via `j`/`k`/`/`.
* Interacting with a single message.
* Default keybindings include:
   * Move around via `j`/`k`.
   * Delete a message with 'd'.
   * Reply to a message with 'r'.



Building/Installation
---------------------

The application is developed in C++ and has intentionally minimal dependencies:

* lua 5.1 - The scripting language.
    * lua 5.2 is supported too, but is not the default.
* libncursesw - The console input/graphics library.
* libglibmm-2.4 - The Glib C++ interface.
* libgmime-2.6  - The MIME-library.
* libpcre3 - The regular-expression library.

Upon a Debian GNU/Linux system you may install all required packages with:

     # apt-get install libncursesw5-dev libglibmm-2.4-dev liblua5.1-0-dev lua5.1 libgmime-2.6-dev libpcre3-dev

> There are [binary packages for Debian GNU/linux](http://packages.steve.org.uk/lumail/), compiled by the author.

Although we might become more complex in the future the code currently builds
via a simple `Makefile`, and running `make` with no arguments should be sufficient.

Once compiled the client may be executed directly, but you will need to supply
a valid (lua) configuration file:

     $ ./lumail --rcfile ./lumail.lua


Installation should be as simple as copying the supplied configuration file to `/etc/lumail.lua` and copying the binary to `/usr/local/bin`.  If you run `make install` this will be done for you.

**NOTE**: For coding-style please see [CODING-STYLE](CODING-STYLE).


Configuration & Lua-Primitives
------------------------------

If you examine the supplied [lumail.lua](https://raw.github.com/skx/lumail/master/lumail.lua) configuration file you'll get a flavour for the configuration.

The main part of the configuration is to point the mail-client at your local
`Maildir` location, from which all sub-folders will be determined at run-time.

At startup the following two Lua files are evaluated, if present:

* `/etc/lumail.lua`
* `~/.lumail/config.lua`

If neither of those files are present then the client will abort with an error.
This is to ensure that the keymap(s) are defined, etc.

Once you have configuration file you can use any of the [supplied Lua primitives](http://lumail.org/lua/) to do interesting things.  The [online Lua examples](http://lumail.org/examples/) are a good starting point for reference.
