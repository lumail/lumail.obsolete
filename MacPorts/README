See http://guide.macports.org/ for how to use the Portfile correctly.
The TL;DR version is below.

Edit $prefix/etc/macports/sources.conf,
adding a file:/// URL pointed at this MacPorts subdirectory.
Then:
  cd MacPorts/ports; portindex
  port selfupdate

If 'port info lumail' gives something interesting,
try 'port install lumail'.
