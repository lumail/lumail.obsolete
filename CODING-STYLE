Source Code Formatting
----------------------

To ensure that the code, potentially coming from many developers,
remains understandable here are some brief notes on coding-style:

* No TABs in source files.
* No single-line "//" comments.
* Indentation is four spaces.
* Braces go on their own lines.

Run "make style" to test the code prior to committing any changes.

Example of good style:

        if ( foo )
        {
            ..
        }
        else
        {
            ...
        }

Example of bad style:

        if ( foo ) {
         ...
        } else {
         // This is a comment
         ...
        }


Debug Target
------------

We explicitly build two versions of lumail when you run "make":

* lumail
   * The real executable.
* lumail-debug
   * A similar executable with additional debugging checks.

While I do not expect many people to run the latter version, because
it is slower, it is very useful to have.  I will not change this
default behaviour because it can be useful.

I encourage additional assertions and checks being added to the
debug-binary.
